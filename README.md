# The Evolution of Smartphones and Mobile Handsets, 2000-2020

This dataset is the outcome of my PhD thesis entitled “How Product Designs Evolve”. This study analysed the data sheets of 13,212 mobile phones released globally by 297 brands. This census covered the specifications of feature phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and smartphones released between January 2000 and December 2020. Data was collected from specialised mobile phone comparison websites, and 91 product attributes and performance indicators were gathered for each smartphone model. For more information on the methodology, please refer to my thesis at www.designevolution.wiki

Here are some of the key columns in the table:

**General Description:** The dataset includes the manufacturer, release year, model name, and release date of each device.

**Design & Form Factor:** Details about the device's thickness, weight, form factor, touchscreen type, keyboard layout, stylus support, and trackball are provided.

**Display:** The dataset provides extensive information about the display, including diagonal size, resolution, pixel count, PPI, display colours, multi-touch support, pressure-sensitive touch (Force Touch), 3D display support, HDR display, high refresh rate, display notch, always-on display, curved display, and screen-to-body ratio.

**Platform:** Documents the operational system of each device.

**Chip & Memory:** Information about the CPU frequency, CPU cores, lithography, 64-bit support, Geekbench 5 scores, and RAM memory is provided.

**Storage:** The dataset specifies the internal storage capacity and whether the device has a memory card slot.

**Rear Camera:** Comprehensive information about the rear camera(s) is provided, including the number of cameras, resolution, optical zoom, flash, lens types, sensor types, stabilisation, video recording capabilities, autofocus, and LiDAR.

**Front Camera:** Information about the front camera(s), including the number of front cameras, resolution, and unique features like motorised pop-up and under display cameras, is provided.

**Network:** The dataset documents whether each device supports 3G, 4G, 5G, NFC, dual SIM, Wi-Fi, GPS, and FM radio.

**Connections:** Documents whether the device supports USB-C.

**Battery:** The dataset includes the battery capacity, whether the battery is removable, and whether the device supports fast charging, wireless charging, and reverse charging.

**Audio:** The type of audio output is documented.

**Sensors:** The dataset provides a comprehensive list of sensors each device supports, including proximity, ambient light, accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, barometer, altimeter, ambient temperature, gesture, humidity, fingerprint, heart rate, oxygen saturation, iris scanner, and infrared facial sensor.

**Other Features:** Unique features like desktop mode, virtual reality certification, projector, and TV are also documented.
